# AgGym
AgGym is a modular design Simulation platform as a Gym environment that focuses on biotic stress simulation and spread dynamics with a user-definable management zone size. AgGym can simulate the spread of a default biotic threat, operate effectively with the deep RL agent and give a list of management actions (i.e., pesticide application). 
This environment aims to be easily customizable, allowing users to adapt and enhance its structure with new methods, codes, and modules to suit their needs. The modularity feature depends on users setting up modules that are then activated by making requests within the configuration files as indicated in detail in the following figure.
